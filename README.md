The purpose of my project is to predict fluid intelligence of individuals from functional connectivity data in the HCP dataset. 

Fluid Intelligence is understood as the intrinsic ability of humans that are unlikely to be affected by environmental changes throughout an individual's lifetime. This can be measured by test such as pattern recognition. 

Functional connectivity is data from different regions of the brain, and compares the relationship between a region of the brain with the other. They usually exist as a symmetical matrix, and code needs to be written to extract the bottom half of the triangular matrix (to reduce processing time)
